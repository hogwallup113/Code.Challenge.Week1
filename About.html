<p>We offer a light breakfast for the early birds, outdoor seating, several types of coffee and tea from all corners of the word.  Our baristas spend two intense years of training in the mountains of Japan where they recieve the best training in the world from the top coffee chefs.  Our doors are open to everyone, but especially to young professionals aged 25 to 40.</p><br>
