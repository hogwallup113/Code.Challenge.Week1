  We are open Monay through Friday, from 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM.
  
<p>We first opened the doors to our humble coffeeshop 15 years ago nestled in the heart of the Pearl District of Portland, Oregon.  We source our coffee beans from responsible growers, with the highest standards of quality and utmost care in roasting.  Hear what our loyal customers have praised about our coffee shop.</p>
