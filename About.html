  We are open Monay through Friday, from 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM.
  
<p>We first opened the doors to our humble coffeeshop in 2016 ago nestled in the heart of the Pearl District of Portland, Oregon.  We source our coffee beans from responsible growers, with the highest standards of quality and utmost care in roasting.  Hear what our loyal customers have praised about our coffee shop.</p>
<p>Our address is 123 Portland St., Portland, OR, 97123</p>

<p>We offer a light breakfast for the early birds, outdoor seating, several types of coffee and tea from all corners of the word.  Our baristas spend two intense years of training in the mountains of Japan where they recieve the best training in the world from the top coffee chefs.  Our doors are open to everyone, but especially to young professionals aged 25 to 40.</p>

<p>Here is a wonderful video where you can get the experience of the coffee shop from your own home.</p>
